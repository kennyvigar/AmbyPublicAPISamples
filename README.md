# AmbyPublicAPISamples

Ambyint has a public API where clients can send their production data.  These examples were developed for clients who needed some assistance interacting with API endpoints.   Simple NodeJS and Python examples are anomomysed and the endpoints are public facing. 

Unfortunetly, without a valid client id/secret you will not be able to run this code, they are described in comments what the return would look like.
